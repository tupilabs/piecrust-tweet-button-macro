{"parts":[{"content":"Welcome to your new website powered by [PieCrust]!\n\nAs you can see there's a couple of nice pages already created for you, along with a simple\nblog with a few posts. If you intend to write a lot of blog posts with tags and categories,\nplease look into [baking your site][1] for better performance.\n\n## More stuff\n\nThere's a few other things set up for you:\n\n* Some templates for adding [Blueprint][2] or [Less][3] to your pages. This very page is\n  actually rendered with them.\n* Some macros to add a [Disqus][4] thread or some [Google analytics][5] to your pages. One\n  macro we're using here is the one to import a [Google WebFont][6].\n\n\n## What now?\n\nNow you just need to add the really tasty bits!\n\n* Edit the `_content\/config.yml` file and change what obviously needs to be.\n* Add new pages in `_content\/pages`, edit or remove the `about` page.\n* Get rid of the sample posts in `_content\/posts` and add your own.\n* Drop in your own CSS.\n* Change some of the template files in `_content\/templates\/` (_e.g._ `default`, `blog`, `post`\n  and `partial_post`).\n* Make yourself at home!\n\n\n  [PieCrust]: http:\/\/bolt80.com\/piecrust\/\n  [1]: http:\/\/bolt80.com\/piecrust\/doc\/baking\n  [2]: http:\/\/blueprintcss.org\n  [3]: http:\/\/lesscss.org\n  [4]: http:\/\/disqus.com\n  [5]: http:\/\/www.google.com\/analytics\n  [6]: http:\/\/www.google.com\/webfonts\n","format":null}]}
